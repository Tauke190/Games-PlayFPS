# FPS GAME

The game incorporates elements introduced in the tutorial along with additional features outlined in the fitness point. Notably, I've introduced a shield, health, and endurance system, enhancing the player's survival mechanics. Additionally, a screen shake system has been implemented to heighten immersion.

In this game, the player's objective revolves around defending a base situated at the center of a mountainous terrain. Initially, drones patrol the area, but upon entering their radius, they become hostile and initiate attacks against the player. It's a test of skill and strategy as you navigate the hostile environment, utilizing your newfound abilities to safeguard the base and survive the onslaught of enemy drones.
